# So you wanna make a web service

These are instructions on getting a production-grade web service up and running on AWS,
mainly for me to reference back to when I create a new deployment. Includes instructions
on domain registration, setting up SSL, load balancing, setting up e-mail, etc.

I recommend the [serverless setup](Serverless.md), but if you want to run your own servers
try the [EC2 setup](EC2.md).
